  Talking Companion
</h1>
<p>
Have you noticed during a long ride that it would be nice to hear what are those places along the route?
</p>

<p>
Talking Companion is a minimalistic app that does just that.  It announces places nearby as you drive or walk.
</p>

<p>
You may find it useful while travelling to new areas. It also can be interesting to discover new places along familiar roads.
</p>

<p>
Note that when the app is running continued use of GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
